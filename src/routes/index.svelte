<h2 class="font-bold mt-8">Who are we?</h2>
<p>
  #YouthAgainstCovid19 is a collective of African youth who want to make a
  difference in the continent and have an impact in the fight against the novel
  coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
  We are self-organized, self-motivated, and passionate individuals from all
  across the continent with a wide range of different backgrounds, skillsets,
  and perspectives.
</p>
<p>
  We believe that pan-African collaboration and organizing is key to fighting
  this disease.
